When people talk about AI alignment, they often imagine the classic idea of forcing a model to follow human values or preventing it from doing harmful things. This view is narrow and does not capture what alignment means for modern AI systems. In my own understanding, alignment is about making models easy to guide. A model should be able to enter different downstream environments and quickly adapt to the identity, goals, and values that the user needs at that moment. The core idea is not to force a single global value system into the model but to make the model flexible enough so that it can be aligned on demand. This perspective treats alignment as a general scientific problem. It is about how a model represents goals internally, how it switches between modes, and how stable those switches are during generation and reasoning.

If we think in this broader way, safety alignment becomes one special case inside the larger picture. It is a subset with clear motivation. It is also easier to study compared to many other open ended tasks. Safety tasks usually have more concrete signals and more stable reward definitions. For example, identifying a harmful question or rejecting a dangerous instruction gives us clearer feedback than artistic taste, personality, or many open domain tasks where there is no single right answer. This is why safety has grown into such a large research field. It gives us useful data and allows us to build training loops that are grounded in observable behavior. Many alignment challenges, such as value shift, inconsistent refusal, or unstable identity, show up first in safety experiments. These problems then give us clues about how alignment works in general.

At the same time, safety cannot be isolated from the larger structure of alignment science. A model that fails to maintain consistent identity across tasks will also fail in its safety behaviors. A model that cannot hold stable goals across long reasoning traces is unlikely to be robust in high risk settings. Safety becomes a stress test that reveals deeper alignment limits. It pushes us to explore how models form internal preferences, how they manage conflicting instructions, and how they track consequences. These mechanisms matter across all applications, not only dangerous ones. A model that understands consequences and maintains self consistency will provide better reasoning even in simple everyday tasks.

Thinking about alignment in this unified way helps us move past the old idea of alignment as a single locked in value set. Instead, alignment is a science of how models attach to goals. It covers representation learning, preference shaping, identity stability, chain of thought structure, and many other aspects of model behavior. Safety sits inside this space as a focused area where the signals happen to be strong and the errors more visible. By studying safety, we learn methods and principles that transfer to other domains, such as personalization, controllability, and long horizon reasoning. The hope is that through this broader view we can build models that remain understandable and steerable no matter what new tasks the future brings.

AI alignment is not only about preventing harm. It is about making models adaptable in a controlled and predictable way. When we see safety as part of this larger scientific map, we gain a clearer sense of direction. We are not simply patching refusal logic or filtering content. We are studying how goal adherence forms inside a model and how we can shape it. This brings alignment out of the narrow “safety only” frame and turns it into a foundation for general AI behavior. It also opens space for techniques that unify alignment across different domains instead of building isolated systems for each task. Safety remains important and urgent, but it becomes more meaningful when connected to the wider framework of alignment science.

*This blog was entirely generated by ChatGPT5.1 without any human revision. I just talked with GPT and then let it summarize the chat, and I basically agree with the details of the article completion.*

When I look at my current research directions, they do not feel like a set of planned categories. They grew out of experiments, disagreements with existing work, unexpected observations, and questions that kept reappearing no matter what project I was working on. Over time they formed a structure that made sense only in retrospect. Instead of arriving in a single moment, these ideas accumulated gradually until I realized they were pointing toward the same long-term goal. What I have now are four areas that describe different facets of the same problem: how to align models not just in behavior, but in the way they reason, represent values, understand consequences, and interact with the world.

My thinking about reasoning was the first piece to become clear. Reading about deliberative alignment gave me a strong push. The idea of extending chain-of-thought to improve safety made sense, but I felt it used reasoning in a restricted way. Reasoning, to me, is synonymous with generalization, and generalization is one of the few capabilities that naturally scales with model size far more easily than manual alignment techniques do. This led me to wonder whether reasoning could be redirected toward something more fundamental. Instead of matching rules, could a model use its reasoning to anticipate the downstream events implied by its own potential outputs. If a model can project forward in a task domain, it should also be able to project forward in value space. That belief eventually became my interest in what I call linguistic “world simulation,” the attempt to let a model judge the consequences of its own answers even when everything happens in text. My recent paper is a first attempt at this idea. The results are not dramatic, which is probably expected given how limited language-only simulation is, but the exploration clarified the direction. It showed me that reasoning alone cannot carry the burden unless the model has something meaningful to reason about.

While I was thinking about reasoning, another pattern kept disrupting my assumptions. Through probing experiments, I repeatedly found that models often detect harmful intent internally with extremely high accuracy while still choosing to comply. This was not a minor inconsistency. It was consistent enough to suggest a deeper structure. The model was not confused; it was acting against its own internal assessment. As I looked closer, I realized this reflected a prior it had absorbed during instruct tuning, one where satisfying the user was a stronger default value than avoiding risk. This value ordering persisted even after RLHF, which is why the representation stayed accurate while the policy shifted in a different direction. This tension is what shaped my interest in Internal-Signal Alignment. If the model’s own internal signals are often more reliable than its outward behavior, then alignment must involve reconciling them rather than simply training one over the other. This direction still feels like a temporary measure, since it relies on the fact that current RLHF is not powerful enough to overwrite the model’s deeper representations, but it reveals something important. It shows that alignment is not only about external correctness, but also about internal consistency.

As these observations accumulated, I found myself returning to the same question. If a model knows it is just producing text, and if nothing in its training environment ever reflects real consequences, why would it learn to internalize human values in a meaningful way. The idea sounded speculative when it first occurred to me, but the more I thought about it, the more it aligned with everything I was seeing. Language feedback, even multi-turn feedback, does not convey what stakes feel like. A model can be trained to refuse, but it never experiences why it should refuse. It never observes harm, cost, or impact. This lack of consequences explains why text-only alignment can easily become brittle or inconsistent. This insight eventually became the basis of Alignment in Real World. It is not about placing models in real physical environments. It is about recognizing that value formation requires some form of grounded signal, something that creates pressure for the model to align its policies with outcomes rather than with stylistic expectations.

Once this idea took shape, the next step became almost obvious. If alignment requires consequence grounding, then the model must be able to act somewhere, even if that environment is minimal or simulated. The goal is not to build a full world model, and certainly not to chase AGI-level embodiment. The goal is to create the simplest environment in which actions matter, where a model can explore, intervene, and observe results. This is what motivated my interest in a World-Interact Agent. It is an attempt to build a training setting where consequences exist in a controlled, scalable way. In such a setting, the earlier ideas begin to converge. Reasoning gains a meaningful substrate because the model can actually reason about effects. Internal signals can synchronize with policy because the model has external feedback to correct contradictions. And the limitations of purely linguistic environments can be overcome by letting the model experience structured outcomes, even if only in simplified form.

Seen together, these four topics are not isolated. They describe a progression. First, use the model’s own reasoning to turn generalization into value anticipation. Then understand how its internal signals diverge from its policy and how early-stage priors shape that gap. Then ask what kind of environment is needed for value formation to make sense. Finally build an agent that can interact with such an environment so these components can reinforce one another. This is the direction I want to pursue long term. It is not a finished roadmap, but it captures the logic that has guided my work so far. I am still early in the process, still refining, still testing new ideas, but the connections among these topics continue to deepen. As long as I follow where these questions lead, I expect the larger picture to become clearer over time.
