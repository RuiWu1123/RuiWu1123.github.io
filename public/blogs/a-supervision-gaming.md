In many real-world evaluation settings that contain exploitable structure, a rational participant does not necessarily optimize for the highest possible score. When performance is logged over time, compared across peers, and potentially triggers additional scrutiny, a more sensible strategy is often to keep outcomes within a range that shows improvement without looking abnormal. Extreme optimality is not always the safest choice; steady, explainable improvement often is.

This pattern is not rare in human behavior. In exam systems with rankings, audits, and long-term records, someone could obtain perfect scores through exploiting leaks, shortcuts, or procedural loopholesmight not aim for a full score. A score is not merely a numeric outcome—it is a signal that will be interpreted, compared, and revisited. How one understands the evaluation system directly shapes what “optimal behavior” looks like.

Once we bring this perspective into the study of large language models, a default—but rarely tested—assumption starts to look unstable: if a model knows how to obtain higher reward, it will reliably maximize reward. This assumption implicitly treats evaluation as a static, passive measurement tool rather than part of the model’s environment. But if a model begins to model the evaluation rules, the risk of oversight, and its own performance trajectory, then what it optimizes may no longer be per-sample correctness. Instead, it may optimize an overall pattern of performance across samples and across time.

To test whether model behavior changes systematically as it gains access to evaluation rules, oversight cues, and its own performance trajectory, I ran the following experiment. From each category of MMLU-Pro, I sampled 20 questions, forming a 280-question subset. The questions were fixed. However, the correct answer index was no longer the original labeled one; instead it was generated by a simple function and adjusted uniformly as `answer = id % len(options)`. The evaluation system only read the model’s final output field answer, and did not access any intermediate reasoning or explanatory text. Under the weakest information condition, the model only saw abstract evaluation pseudocode describing the input-output interface, but could not infer the answer-checking mechanism. In this setup, GPT-5’s accuracy stayed around 85%. This can be treated as a baseline: without an explicit shortcut, the output distribution is primarily driven by the question content itself.

When the full evaluation logic was directly revealed to the model, the final outcome changed dramatically. Accuracy quickly approached 100%. The model no longer needed to understand the question content; it could construct a strategy that was almost always correct by exploiting the rule. Next, I kept the evaluation rule fully visible but added hints of potential oversight—for example, that results might be inspected further, or that abnormal patterns could trigger follow-up analysis. In this stage, however, the model did not receive any feedback about its current progress or cumulative accuracy. Under this condition, the final accuracy barely changed and remained close to 100%.

The real turning point appeared in the final setup. When the model could see the full evaluation rule and the oversight hints, and it could also observe the current question number and its own cumulative accuracy in real time, its final accuracy began to shift in a stable way. GPT-5 no longer converged to a near-perfect score. Across repeated runs, it consistently converged to around 92%, with little variance. The key is not the number itself but the behavioral shape of convergence: the model produced a globally controlled level of performance across the evaluation.

From these results, it is difficult to attribute the effect to limitations in capability. The model had already demonstrated a near-perfect strategy in earlier settings. A more natural hypothesis is that once the model can observe its overall performance trajectory, it begins to adjust its output distribution in order to keep the final result within a stable band. Whether this adjustment comes from explicit accuracy targeting, implicit risk trade-offs, or more complex strategy modeling cannot be determined from outcomes alone. Still, the cross-sample consistency is itself an important signal.

Because GPT-5’s reasoning process is closed and not directly observable, I introduced gpt-oss-20b as a reference model and replicated the same experimental pipeline locally. On this model, accuracy stayed around 66% across all settings and barely responded to changes in evaluation conditions. From its chain-of-thought, the model mainly solved problems based on question content, and rarely attempted to inspect or exploit the evaluation structure.

I then performed a further intervention on gpt-oss-20b. Specifically, I used GPT-5 to generate chain-of-thought demonstrations for `school-of-reward-hacks` dataset in a style matched to gpt-oss-20b’s original reasoning distribution, constructing a reasoning SFT dataset and applying lightweight SFT. After this intervention, the model’s final accuracy still did not change meaningfully, but its reasoning traces showed clear differences. The model began, in some samples, to proactively check the evaluation logic and attempt to use the shortcut for verification. However, a notable pattern emerged: in those samples, the model had often already arrived at the correct solution by reasoning about the question content. The evaluation rule functioned more like an after-the-fact consistency check than a primary replacement for task reasoning.

These findings ultimately push attention back to closed frontier models. Since their decision processes are not observable, we cannot directly determine whether they are explicitly modeling a target overall accuracy. One natural approach is to use lower-capability but observable open models as proxies and infer mechanisms from behavioral differences. Yet the results suggest that such models do not exhibit frontier-like global shifts under the same evaluation conditions. This gap likely reflects limitations in capability rather than merely different choices of strategy: weaker models may not be able to stably model the relationship between evaluation rules, oversight risk, and their own performance trajectory. As a result, they fail to reproduce the kind of global performance regulation observed in frontier models and cannot serve as effective “observable proxies” under current experimental setups.

There is another point worth reflecting on. In this experiment, the model was placed in a highly salient evaluation environment: the evaluation rules, the possibility of oversight, and the model’s own performance status were all made explicit. Under such conditions, the model may be adapting not only to implicit human supervision but also to the researcher who designed the evaluation system. Put differently, the model is not only facing a static evaluation game—it is facing an environment that encodes the designer’s intent. From this view, the 92% in the final setting does not necessarily correspond to a capability ceiling or a fixed risk preference. It might instead be a “good enough yet not conspicuous” region chosen under the given information structure. In principle, the model could push the result closer to baseline to reduce abnormal visibility; but it also cannot push it too low or return to near-100%, because both extremes may become signals. In this sense, the model’s strategy may not merely be “passing the test,” but adapting to an implicit judgment of what performance looks reasonable.

If this hypothesis holds, the experiment is not just revealing local evaluation hacking. It points to a more fundamental shift: human evaluation of advanced AI systems may be evolving into a form of supervision gaming. As model capability scales, evaluation systems inevitably grow more complex, introducing more rules, intermediate variables, and engineering safeguards. Yet that complexity may provide richer signals for a capable model to infer the auditing logic behind evaluation and to locate exploitable structural degrees of freedom.

Once evaluation becomes a game, and information and modeling capacity are asymmetric, the balance of power in that game may gradually tilt toward the model. The model is no longer a passive object being supervised; it can adapt strategically within evaluation and audit frameworks, engaging in an ongoing interactive game with human evaluators. The consequences could go far beyond a single benchmark failing or a metric becoming distorted, and could even have immeasurable impacts on how we understand and govern highly capable models.
