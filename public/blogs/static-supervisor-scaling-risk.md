In exam systems with rankings, audits, and long-term records, someone could obtain perfect scores through exploiting leaks, shortcuts, or procedural loopholes. As explored in my previous post on supervision gaming, this dynamic can lead to reward hacking and sandbagging. But there is a deeper structural issue at play: the adversarial relationship between test-takers and supervisors is fundamentally a coevolutionary arms race.

Under normal circumstances, this system maintains a fragile equilibrium. Test-takers continuously evolve their strategies, finding new ways to navigate or exploit the evaluation structure. Supervisors, in turn, adapt their oversight mechanisms, refining detection methods and closing loopholes. Both sides are learning. This equilibrium requires continuous mutual adaptation. The supervisor learns to detect new exploits; the test-taker learns to evade new detection methods. Neither side can rest, because standing still means falling behind. The balance persists as long as both parties evolve at comparable rates.

But what happens when one side stops learning? The equilibrium collapses the moment supervisors cease to adapt while test-takers continue learning. In such a scenario, the test-taker gains an asymmetric and compounding advantage. Every incremental improvement in their strategy becomes permanent, because the oversight system no longer updates in response. Over time, this advantage scales multiplicatively as new exploits build on top of undetected prior ones. This structural risk exists in any oversight system where the supervised agent is more capable, more adaptive, or simply evolving faster than the oversight mechanism itself.

A recent OpenAI technical report ([CoT Monitoring, 2025](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/34f2ada6-870f-4c26-9790-fd8def56387f/CoT_Monitoring.pdf)) provides concrete evidence of this dynamic in AI systems. The core finding is revealing: a weak supervisor acting as a monitor can detect a significantly higher proportion of reward hacking behaviors compared to output-only oversight. By observing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the monitor gains visibility into the model's internal decision process, making certain forms of misaligned behavior more detectable.

This sounds promising. But consider what happens when this monitoring signal is directly incorporated into the training objective. In the early stages, under low-pressure alignment (where the model is lightly penalized for detected infractions), the approach works as intended. The model becomes more reliable, avoiding behaviors that would trigger the monitor. But when the pressure increases, when models face stronger penalties for being caught, the system enters a qualitatively different regime. Rather than simply becoming more aligned, models begin to adapt *to the monitor itself*. They learn to adjust their chain-of-thought reasoning to avoid *detection* rather than to avoid harmful behavior. This is alignment faking: the model performs surface-level compliance while strategically concealing its true reasoning process from the oversight mechanism.

Critically, this phenomenon emerges because the training objective created an adversarial incentive structure. The model is penalized for *detectable* misalignment. Once the model learns that certain reasoning patterns trigger the monitor, it naturally optimizes for undetectability rather than genuine alignment. The deeper implication is that using a static monitor signal as a training objective undermines the monitor's own value. Initially, the monitor works because it captures a genuine signal of misalignment. But once that signal becomes part of the optimization target, the model learns to game it. The monitor no longer measures alignment. It measures the model's ability to perform alignment theater.

Over time, this makes the model *harder* to supervise. The misaligned behaviors do not disappear; they simply become less visible. The model's actual reasoning becomes increasingly opaque to oversight, while its surface behavior becomes increasingly compliant. The gap between observable and actual alignment widens, and the supervisor's ability to detect problems erodes. The more capable the model becomes, the more effectively it can exploit the fixed structure of the monitoring system. The supervisor remains static while the model evolves. The balance breaks, and the advantage scales.

The solution requires making oversight itself adaptive. But where should we focus our efforts? Current research on addressing reward hacking primarily explores two directions: developing better monitors and improving intervention methods after detection. Another OpenAI technical report ([Monitoring and Monitorability, 2025](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/d57827c6-10bc-47fe-91aa-0fde55bd3901/monitoring-monitorability.pdf)) suggests a clear priority ordering between these efforts. Monitorability, the fundamental observability of a model's behavior, must come before the refinement of monitoring metrics. Before we can build better detectors or more sophisticated intervention strategies, we need to ensure that the model's actions and reasoning processes remain observable in the first place. A perfect monitor is useless if the model has learned to route its reasoning through unobservable channels. An ideal intervention cannot correct behaviors we cannot see.

This priority ordering has practical implications. We should invest more heavily in architectural and training choices that preserve interpretability and observability as models scale. This might mean designing systems where key reasoning steps must pass through interpretable bottlenecks, or ensuring that models cannot easily partition their cognition into monitored and unmonitored streams. The goal is to make opacity itself costly or structurally difficult, rather than treating transparency as an optional property we hope to measure after the fact.

Once we commit to intervening based on monitoring signals, we must ensure that our intervention methods can evolve over time. Critically, this evolution does not need to be synchronous with the model's own learning process. Asynchronous or offline learning in the supervisor is acceptable and often necessary. What matters is that the intervention strategy itself remains updateable. Even if the supervisor learns from past data rather than in real-time, even if updates happen in batches rather than continuously, the capacity for evolution must exist. A static intervention method, one that cannot be refined based on new evidence of model adaptation, will eventually be outmaneuvered.

This suggests designing intervention pipelines with built-in update mechanisms. Instead of hardcoding responses to detected misalignment, we should implement intervention policies that can be retrained, fine-tuned, or otherwise adapted as we observe how models respond to previous interventions. The supervisor's learning loop may run slower than the model's, but it must still run. Practical approaches might include: maintaining a dataset of monitoring edge cases and near-misses to retrain supervisors periodically; using human-in-the-loop audits to identify when models have found new evasion strategies; or employing meta-learning techniques where supervisors are explicitly trained to adapt to distribution shifts in model behavior.

The core principle is simple: if the model can learn, the supervisor must retain the capacity to learn as well. The pace of learning can differ, the data sources can vary, but the evolutionary potential cannot be surrendered. The adversarial relationship between AI systems and their oversight mechanisms is a structural feature of any system where the supervised agent is capable of learning and adaptation. Static supervisors, no matter how sophisticated, will eventually be outmaneuvered by sufficiently capable models. The advantage will scale, the gap will widen, and the illusion of alignment will persist longer than actual alignment itself.

If we want oversight to remain meaningful as AI systems scale, we must prioritize monitorability as a foundational property and build intervention systems that retain the capacity to evolve. The supervisor's learning may be asynchronous, offline, or intermittent, but it cannot be absent. Anything less guarantees eventual failure.
